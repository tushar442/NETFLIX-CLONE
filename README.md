The main goal of this project is to replicate the core features and aesthetics of the Netflix website. By doing so, you'll gain hands-on experience in front-end development, learn how to structure a web page with HTML, style it with CSS, and add dynamic functionality with JavaScript. Additionally, we'll leverage the Netflix API to fetch real movie and TV show data, providing an authentic user experience.
 Technology used:
HTML: To structure the basic layout of our Netflix clone, defining sections for header, main content, and footer.
CSS: Styling elements to mimic the visual appeal of the Netflix interface. This includes working on responsive design for optimal user experience across different devices.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity to our clone, such as image sliders, navigation functionality, and dynamically updating content.
Netflix API: Incorporating the Netflix API to fetch real-time data, including movie titles, descriptions, images, and other relevant information.
